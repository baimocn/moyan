 What's New in v0.3 
 v0.3 makes Skill-Anything actually usable on long sources — books, multi-hour talks, large repos. 
 v0.1 and v0.2 silently degraded on anything past ~15K characters: the knowledge generator truncated input, quiz/flashcard generation hit hard per-call caps before reaching later chapters, and every LLM call was sequential with no caching. v0.3 introduces a section-aware, map-reduce pipeline with concurrency and a disk cache, so a 12-chapter book produces a study pack that actually covers every chapter. 
 
 Section-aware parsing across every source type (PDF uses the embedded outline; text/web split by headings; video/audio bucket transcripts into 5-min sections; repos produce one Section per file) 
 Map-reduce knowledge generation — per-section map calls produce local summary/concepts/notes; a single reduce call synthesizes the global summary, cheat sheet, takeaways, and learning path. detailed_notes is assembled deterministically with no truncation. 
 Per-section quota allocation for quiz/flashcards/exercises — largest-remainder weighting by section size with a guaranteed minimum per section, so every chapter gets coverage even on a small total budget 
 Concurrent LLM execution + disk cache — ThreadPoolExecutor map runner with rich progress bars, per-section failure isolation, and a sha256(prompt+model+version) cache so second runs of the same source skip every cached call 
 Two-tier model routing — SKILL_ANYTHING_MODEL_FAST for map calls, SKILL_ANYTHING_MODEL_SMART for reduce 
 New CLI flags — --concurrency / -c (default 6) and --no-cache on every source command 
 
 sa pdf book.pdf --format all --concurrency 8 # long PDF, parallel map 
sa pdf book.pdf --format all --concurrency 8 # second run: cache hits, finishes in seconds 
sa text long-notes.md --no-cache # bypass cache for a clean run

 Every chapter (1–12) is represented , including narrower topics like CRDTs and messaging semantics that v0.2 routinely dropped once the per-call cap was hit at chapter 2. 
 
 If v0.2 was "any source -> study pack -> reusable skill toolchain", v0.3 is "any source, including long ones , with caching and concurrency built in". 
 
 
 What's New in v0.2 
 v0.2 turns Skill-Anything into a lightweight repo-to-skill toolchain. 
 
 sa repo <path-or-github-url> scans a local repo or public GitHub repo and builds an onboarding-ready study pack 
 sa import-skill <dir-or-skill-md> imports an existing SKILL.md package back into a reusable study pack / YAML pack 
 sa lint <dir-or-skill-md> validates a skill package and fails on blocking packaging or asset errors 
 
 Best for in v0.2 
 
 turning a codebase into onboarding notes, glossary, quiz, and learning path 
 importing external SKILL.md packages back into your own workflow 
 checking a skill package before you share, publish, or re-export it 
 
 sa repo . --format all
sa repo https://github.com/openai/openai-python --format study
sa import-skill ./output/my-skill --format study
sa lint ./output/my-skill 
 
 If v0.1 was “any source -> study pack”, v0.2 is “any source -> study pack -> reusable skill toolchain”. 
 
 v0.2 Mini Demo 
 Turn a repo into a reusable pack, re-import it, and validate it before sharing: 
 
 
 
 # 1) Generate from a repo 
sa repo https://github.com/openai/openai-python --output ./output/openai-python --format all

 # 2) Bring the exported skill back into your own workflow 
sa import-skill ./output/openai-python/skill --output ./output/openai-python-reimported --format study

 # 3) Validate the package before publishing 
sa lint ./output/openai-python/skill 
 output/openai-python/
├── study_guide.md
├── pack.yaml
├── quiz.md
├── flashcards.md
└── skill/
 ├── SKILL.md
 ├── assets/
 ├── references/
 └── scripts/
 
 This is the v0.2 advantage in one loop: generate from repos, reuse existing skills, and catch packaging problems before re-exporting. 
 Real Output Case 
 Transformer Architecture is a good showcase because it makes both sides of Skill-Anything obvious:
deep study-pack output for humans, and clean SKILL.md export for AI tools. 
 
 
 
 Case 1: a full study guide with summary, notes, glossary, cheat sheet, quiz, flashcards, exercises, and learning path. 
 
 
 
 
 Case 2: the same pack exported as a reusable SKILL.md directory with references, assets, and scripts. 
 
 Why Skill-Anything? 
 AI agents are getting smarter, but humans still learn the same broken way — read, forget, re-read, forget again. Research shows passive reading retains ~10% of information, while active recall (quizzes, flashcards, spaced repetition) pushes retention to 80%+. Creating those materials manually? Nobody has time. 
 Skill-Anything automates the entire pipeline. One command. Any source. Structured study pack by default, optional AI skill export when you need it. 
 
 
 
 Pain Point 
 How Skill-Anything Solves It 
 
 
 
 
 Passive reading — read once, forget in a week 
 12-section study guide auto-generated with structured notes, cheat sheet, and concept map 
 
 
 No active recall — no quizzes, no testing 
 6 quiz types (MCQ, scenario, comparison, ...) with detailed explanations and A-F grading 
 
 
 No spaced repetition — no flashcards, no review schedule 
 Auto-generated flashcards with multi-round CLI review mode 
 
 
 Manual note-taking — hours of summarizing 
 AI-powered knowledge extraction — glossary, key concepts, takeaways in seconds 
 
 
 No learning path — what to study next? 
 Prerequisites + next steps + recommended resources auto-generated 
 
 
 Source-locked — knowledge stuck in one format 
 Any source → structured YAML — reusable across tools and workflows 
 
 
 
 
 Positioning 
 Skill-Anything has two layers of output : 
 
 Study Pack (default) : a structured learning package built from raw source material 
 Agent Skill Export (optional) : a SKILL.md directory generated from that pack for Claude Code, Cursor, or Codex 
 
 That distinction matters: 
 
 A PDF, video, or webpage is not a skill by itself 
 Skill-Anything first turns it into a study pack : notes, quiz, flashcards, exercises, glossary, and structured YAML 
 If you want, that pack can then be exported into an agent-ready skill artifact 
 
 If you remember only one sentence, remember this: 
 
 Skill-Anything converts source material into a reusable study pack, and can optionally export that pack as an AI-tool-compatible skill.

 Skill Export 
 Skill-Anything can export the generated pack as a SKILL.md directory — the format used by Claude Code , Cursor , and Codex . 
 This is the key mental model: 
 
 study is for humans learning from the material 
 skill is for AI tools loading the material as a reusable artifact 
 all is for teams or workflows that want both 
 
 Generate as Agent Skill Export 
 # Generate from any source and export directly as a skill 
sa auto paper.pdf --format skill
sa pdf textbook.pdf --format skill
sa web https://example.com/article --format skill

 # Or export an existing pack 
sa export output/my-skill.yaml --format skill

 # Generate both study pack + skill export 
sa auto paper.pdf --format all 
 Skill Directory Structure 
 output/my-skill/
├── SKILL.md # Frontmatter + core knowledge (key concepts, cheat sheet, takeaways)

 # Cursor 
cp -r output/my-skill/ ~ /.cursor/skills/

 # Project-level (any tool) 
cp -r output/my-skill/ .claude/skills/ 
 The generated SKILL.md follows the standard format with YAML frontmatter ( name , description , version ) and uses progressive disclosure: compact core knowledge in SKILL.md , detailed references and structured assets alongside it. 
 
 Quiz Types 
 6 question types designed to test different cognitive levels: 
 
 
 
 Type 
 Cognitive Level 
 Example 
 
 
 
 
 Multiple Choice 
 Remember 
 "Which algorithm does X?" — 4 options with plausible distractors 
 
 
 True / False 
 Understand 
 "Statement: X always implies Y" — precise, testable claims 
 
 
 Fill in the Blank 
 Remember 
 "The attention formula is softmax(QK^T / ___)" 
 
 
 Short Answer 
 Analyze 
 "Explain why X matters for Y" — 2-3 sentence response 
 
 
 Scenario 
 Apply 
 "You're building X with constraint Y. What approach?" 
 
 
 Comparison 
 Evaluate 
 "Compare method A vs B for task Z — trade-offs?" 
 
 
 
 Example quiz session: 
 $ sa quiz output/transformer.yaml --difficulty hard --count 10

--- Q1/10 --- HARD (Scenario)

 You're designing a search engine where queries are short
 but documents are long. How would you adapt the standard
 Transformer attention for efficiency?

 Answer > Use cross-attention with query as Q, chunked docs as K/V...

 Reference answer: Apply asymmetric attention — short queries attend
 to long documents via cross-attention with linear-complexity
 approximations like Linformer or chunked processing...

 FAQ 
 Does it work without an LLM API key? 
 Yes. Without an API key, Skill-Anything falls back to rule-based generation . All features work (quiz, flashcards, notes, etc.) but the quality is lower compared to LLM-powered generation. The concept map image requires an image generation API and will be skipped when unavailable. 
 
 How can a PDF or video become a "skill"? 
 Strictly speaking, the raw PDF or video does not become a skill by itself. 
 The pipeline is: 
 
 Extract content from the source 
 Turn it into a structured study pack ( .yaml , .md , quizzes, flashcards, exercises) 
 Optionally export that pack as a SKILL.md directory for AI tools 
 
 So the default output is better thought of as a study pack or knowledge pack . The skill format is an optional export target for agent ecosystems. 
 
 What changed in v0.2? 
 v0.2 adds a lightweight skill toolchain on top of the existing study-pack workflow: 
 
 sa repo for local and public GitHub repositories 
 sa import-skill for importing existing SKILL.md packages back into YAML/study format 
 sa lint for validating skill packages before sharing or re-exporting them 
 
 
 What changed in v0.3? 
 v0.3 makes Skill-Anything work on long sources — books, multi-hour talks, large repos: 
 
 Section-aware parsing (PDF outline, heading-split text/web, time-bucketed video/audio) 
 Map-reduce knowledge generation — per-section map + global reduce, no more 15K-char truncation 
 Per-section quota for quiz / flashcards / exercises — every chapter gets coverage 
 Concurrent LLM execution ( --concurrency ) with a disk cache ( ./output/.skill-anything/ ) 
 Two-tier model routing via SKILL_ANYTHING_MODEL_FAST / SKILL_ANYTHING_MODEL_SMART 
 Bypass the cache with --no-cache for clean runs 
 
 See RELEASE_NOTES_v0.3.md for details and a case study. 
 
 Which format should I use: `study`, `skill`, or `all`? 
 Use study if the main user is a human learner and you want notes, quiz/review commands, and a readable study guide. 
 Use skill if the main user is an AI tool such as Claude Code, Cursor, or Codex and you want a SKILL.md directory. 
 Use all if you want one run to serve both people and AI tools. 
 
 Which LLM providers are supported? 
 Any provider that exposes an OpenAI-compatible chat completions endpoint. This includes OpenAI, DeepSeek, Qwen (Dashscope), Ollama, vLLM, LiteLLM, and many others. Just set SKILL_ANYTHING_API_BASE to the provider's base URL. 
 
 Can I use a local LLM? 
 Yes. Run a local model with Ollama , vLLM , or any OpenAI-compatible server, then point SKILL_ANYTHING_API_BASE to it (e.g. http://localhost:11434/v1 for Ollama). Set SKILL_ANYTHING_API_KEY to any non-empty string (e.g. dummy ). 
 
 How do I process local video files? 
 Skill-Anything needs a subtitle file for video content. Place a .srt or .vtt file alongside your video file (same name, different extension), then run sa video your-video.mp4 . To generate subtitles from audio, use OpenAI Whisper : 
 whisper your-video.mp4 --output_format srt
sa video your-video.srt 
 
 What PDF libraries does it use? 
 The PDF parser tries backends in priority order: pdfplumber (best quality) → pymupdf (fitz) → pypdf . Install at least one. pdfplumber is included with pip install skill-anything[pdf] or [all] . 
 
 Can I customize the number of quiz questions or flashcards? 
 At generation time, the number is determined automatically based on content length. At quiz/review time, use --count / -n to limit the number of questions or cards presented: 
 sa quiz output/pack.yaml -n 10 -d hard # 10 hard questions 
sa review output/pack.yaml -n 20 # 20 flashcards 
 
 What is the output YAML used for? 
 The .yaml file is the structured data store that powers all interactive commands ( sa quiz , sa review , sa info ). You can also load it programmatically via Engine.load() and integrate it into your own tools, pipelines, or AI agent systems.
